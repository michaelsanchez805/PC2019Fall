					<p class="center">Hi, I'm Maria Sanchez, and I'm a Sophomore at Millburn High School.</p>
					<img src="Photos/maria.jpeg" class="pics" alt="Photo of Maria">
					<p>I've been coding since 4th grade, solving interesting problems and creating awesome projects along the way - I'd love to help bring these coding skills to your child.</p>

					<p>Over the past three years, I have helped at Cool Coding with my older brother John. I have taught hundreds of kids computer science, and have built up many tricks for making the learning clear, engaging, and fun. This past summer I taught Little Coders, and it was a great time! We have trained, experienced, and funny high-school aged instructors who will meet your child eye-to-eye and bring coding to life, making the experience a blast.</p>

					<p>Whatever course you choose, I guarantee it'll be an amazing ride!</p>

					<p>I am super passionate about helping to give every kid the coding and STEM skills to succeed. In addition to Power Coding, I am working with friends to create STEMpowerment, a volunteer robotics and coding program that will be held at the Avon School in Newark this fall.</p>

					<p class="center">Hi! My name is Mehul Ghosal, and I’m a senior at Millburn High School.</p>

					<p>I have been programming and coding for more than five years now, and I have learned a lot. My first introduction into computer science was javascript and web development.</p>

					<p>Now, I specialize mostly in Python for machine learning, data analysis, and image manipulation. Right now, I'm actually working on a research project with an advisor at Boston College, using my Python skills for a real-world data science application. </p>

					<p>
					I also work in C++ for Millburn’s VEX robotics team. On top of that, I am one of the lead organizers of hackMHS, Millburn’s local hackathon! I’ve tutored basic and advanced concepts in computer science for many years, and I’m excited for Power Coding.</p>
