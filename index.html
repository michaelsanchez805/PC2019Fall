			<p>Hi, I'm Maria Sanchez, and I'm a Sophomore at Millburn High School.</p>

			<p>I've been coding since 4th grade, solving interesting problems and creating awesome projects along the way - I'd love to help bring these coding skills to your child.</p>

			<p>Over the past three years, I have helped at Cool Coding with my older brother John. I have taught hundreds of kids computer science, and have built up many tricks for making the learning clear, engaging, and fun. This past summer I taught Little Coders, and it was a great time! We have trained, experienced, and funny high-school aged instructors who will meet your child eye-to-eye and bring coding to life, making the experience a blast.</p>

			<p>Whatever course you choose, I guarantee it'll be an amazing ride!</p>

			<p>I am super passionate about helping to give every kid the coding and STEM skills to succeed. In addition to Power Coding, I am working with friends to create STEMpowerment, a volunteer robotics and coding program that will be held at the Avon School in Newark this fall.</p>
			<p>We are raising money to provide fifty Newark students with full VEX robotics equipment and we’ll also be teaching programming lessons to another fifty students at Avon. We are going to donate 20% of every dollar we receive for Power Coding towards this robotics equipment for Newark students. </p>
